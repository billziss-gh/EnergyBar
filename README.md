EnergyBar replaces your Mac's Touch Bar with a collection of widgets, such as a Dock or a "Now Playing" widget. The goal of EnergyBar is to maximize the Touch Bar's usability, while minimizing some of its flaws such as inadvertent tapping.

![Dock](doc/EnergyBarAnimation.gif)

The default placement of EnergyBar widgets allows for consistency and memorization of your Touch Bar use. The areas around the Esc key and above the Delete key have been kept non-functional to alleviate the problem of inadvertent tapping. At the same time EnergyBar allows for customization so that you only have your favorite widgets visible.

## Widgets

### Dock

![Dock](doc/Dock.png)

- Shows your applications, folders and trash can.
- Tap items on the Dock to launch your applications or access your folders and trash can.
- Alternatively click items on the Dock using your mouse. You can even drag files to it and it will do the right thing!
- Hide the system Dock to regain valuable screen real estate.

### Active App

## Developer Notes

The project source code is organized as follows:

* :file_folder: [build/Xcode](build/Xcode): Xcode workspace
* :file_folder: [rsc](rsc): project resources
* :file_folder: [src](src): project sources
    * :file_folder: [src/System](src/System): macOS system sources
    * :file_folder: [src/Widgets](src/Widgets): widget sources

### How to add a Widget

Adding a widget is fairly simple:

- Create a class named `XxxxWidget` that derives from `NSCustomTouchBarItem` or the convenience class `CustomWidget`. It is important that the class name ends in `Widget`.
- Add the class name (without the `Widget` part) to `-[AppBarController awakeFromNib]`.
- Implement your widget.
